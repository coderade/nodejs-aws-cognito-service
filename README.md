This application was created using the create express component, and demonstrates how to verify the JWT authentication tokens used by AWS Cognito in an express based node.js service. See my article [AWS Cognito example using React UI and Node.js REST APIs â€” part 3 (JWT secured REST APIs)](https://medium.com/@arron.harden/aws-cognito-example-using-react-ui-and-node-js-rest-apis-part-3-jwt-secured-rest-apis-e56d336ce306) for more information.

## Running the application

1. Modify `src/config/app-config.json` to match your user pool and application URLs. When running locally with the UI, the `signoutUri` will property need to be `http://localhost:3000/` and the `callbackUri` property will need to be `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
2. Run `npm install` to setup and install the dependencies.
3. Run `DEBUG=cognito-demo-service:* npm start` to start the service.
4. The service will start listening at `http:localhost:3010`.
5. Using curl call the GET /users REST API:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3010/users -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_JWT_token>'
```

and if successful you should see the following type of response:

```
Successfully verified JWT token. Extracted information: {"sub":"1f0be62f-ffcd-49ca-b5a4-18f0bf62e0e6","token_use":"access","scope":["openid","profile","https://cognito-demo-api.arronharden.com/hello-world.all","email"],"username":"arron"}
```

## React UI client
